name = "devansh"
age = 18
print(name + " is " + age + " years old")

# 'int' value is converted automatically into 'str' by python because a person can find bugs easily by this.
# On the other hand JAVA converts 'int' automatically to 'str' .

# correct code for above
# Name = "Devansh"
# Age = "18"
# print(Name + " is " + Age + " years old")
